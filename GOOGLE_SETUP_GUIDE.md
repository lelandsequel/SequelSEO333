# üìä Google Sheets & Drive Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up automatic uploads to Google Sheets and Google Drive for your SEO lead finder.

---

## üéØ What You'll Get

After setup, your automation will:
- ‚úÖ **Upload CSV data** ‚Üí Google Sheets (structured, filterable data)
- ‚úÖ **Upload sales reports** ‚Üí Google Drive (full intelligence reports)
- ‚úÖ **Access from anywhere** ‚Üí View leads on any device
- ‚úÖ **Share with team** ‚Üí Easy collaboration

## ü§ñ What is a Service Account?

A **Service Account** is like a "robot user" for Google services:

- **Regular Account**: You (human) log in with username/password
- **Service Account**: Robot logs in with a JSON key file

**Why we need it:**
- Your automation runs on GitHub Actions (no human to click "login")
- The service account can upload files automatically
- It's secure - the JSON key is stored as a GitHub Secret

---

### **STEP 5: Note the Service Account Email**

1. **Open the JSON file** you just downloaded (in a text editor)
2. **Find the line** that says `"client_email"`

   - URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123xyz.../edit`
   - ID: `1ABC123xyz...` (the part between `/d/` and `/edit`)

**Save this ID** - you'll need it for your `.env` file!

   - URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XYZ789abc...`
   - ID: `1XYZ789abc...` (the part after `/folders/`)

**Save this ID** - you'll need it for your `.env` file!

---

### **STEP 8: Install the JSON Key File**

1. **Create a `secrets` folder** in your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p secrets
   ```

2. **Move the JSON file** you downloaded to this location:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/seo-lead-finder-*.json secrets/google-service-account.json
   ```

3. **Verify it's there:**
   ```bash
   ls -l secrets/google-service-account.json
   ```

---

### **STEP 9: Update Your `.env` File**

Open `seo_lead_finder/.env` and update these lines:

```bash
# Google Sheets & Drive (OPTIONAL - CSV output always works)
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_PATH=./secrets/google-service-account.json
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=1ABC123xyz...  # ‚Üê Paste your Sheet ID here
GOOGLE_SHEETS_WORKSHEET_NAME=Leads
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1XYZ789abc...  # ‚Üê Paste your Drive Folder ID here
```

**Replace:**
- `1ABC123xyz...` with your actual Spreadsheet ID from Step 6
- `1XYZ789abc...` with your actual Folder ID from Step 7

---

### **STEP 10: Test It Locally**

Run a test search to verify uploads work:

```bash
python3 main.py --once --geo "Houston, TX"
```

**You should see:**
```
‚úÖ CSV saved: ./out/leads_20251014_123456.csv
‚úÖ Uploaded to Google Drive: leads_20251014_123456.csv
   URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/...
‚úÖ Google Sheets updated: 100 rows appended
‚úÖ Sales report saved: ./out/sales_report_Houston_TX_2025-10-14.txt
‚úÖ Uploaded to Google Drive: sales_report_Houston_TX_2025-10-14.txt
   URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/...
```

**Check:**
1. Go to your Google Sheet - you should see lead data
2. Go to your Google Drive folder - you should see CSV + TXT files

---

### **STEP 11: Add to GitHub Secrets (for Automation)**

For weekly automation to work, add the credentials to GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/lelandsequel/SequelSEO333/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add these secrets:

**Secret 1: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON**
- Name: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
- Value: Copy/paste the **entire contents** of `secrets/google-service-account.json`

**Secret 2: GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID**
- Name: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID`
- Value: Your Spreadsheet ID from Step 6

**Secret 3: GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID**
- Name: `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`
- Value: Your Folder ID from Step 7

## ‚úÖ You're Done!

Now your automation will:
- ‚úÖ Save CSV files locally
- ‚úÖ Upload CSV data to Google Sheets
- ‚úÖ Upload CSV files to Google Drive
- ‚úÖ Upload sales reports to Google Drive
- ‚úÖ Work both locally and on GitHub Actions

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Google credentials not found"
- Make sure `secrets/google-service-account.json` exists
- Check the path in your `.env` file

### "Permission denied" or "403 Forbidden"
- Make sure you shared the Sheet/Folder with the service account email
- Check that you gave "Editor" access, not just "Viewer"

### "Spreadsheet not found"
- Double-check the Spreadsheet ID in your `.env` file
- Make sure the service account has access to the sheet

### "Folder not found"
- Double-check the Folder ID in your `.env` file
- Make sure the service account has access to the folder
