## 🎓 Example Use Case

### **Monday Morning:**
You open the sales report and see:

**Lead #1: High 5 Plumbing (Score: 95)**
- Issue: 22 second load time
- Impact: $12K-18K/month loss
- Pitch: "Emergency plumbers need fast sites"
- Quick wins: Speed optimization, emergency CTA

### **Your Call:**
```
"Hi, this is [NAME]. I was researching plumbers in Denver 
and noticed your website takes 22 seconds to load. When 
someone has a plumbing emergency at 2 AM, they're calling 
the first plumber they find - and with a 22 second load 
time, that's not you. 

I specialize in fixing this for plumbing companies. I can 
get your site loading in under 3 seconds and ranking #1 
for 'emergency plumber Denver' in about 30 days.

Do you have 2 minutes to discuss what I found?"
```

### **Result:**
- Specific, data-driven pitch
- Clear value proposition
- Urgency (emergency plumbing)
- Quick wins (30 days)
- Easy yes (just 2 minutes)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"No LLM API key configured"**
- Check `.env` file has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Run `python3 test_all_apis.py` to verify

### **LLM analysis is slow**
- Normal! Takes 10-15 seconds per website
- Only runs for high-scoring leads (60+)
- Adjust threshold in `main.py` if needed

### **No Google Doc created**
- Text report is always created
- Google Docs requires service account JSON
- Enable Docs API in Google Cloud Console

### **Reports are too long**
- Adjust `HOT_LEAD_THRESHOLD` in `.env`
- Edit `report_generator.py` to customize
